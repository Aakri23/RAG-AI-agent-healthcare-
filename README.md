By pulling in up-to-date information, RAG is meant to address the limitations of more traditional LLMs that don’t have access to the latest medical research, Syed says. Use cases for integrating the Amazon Comprehend Medical natural language processing service into a RAG workflow include automating medical coding, generating clinical summaries, analyzing medication side effects and deploying decision support systems.

Internally, RAG makes it possible for LLMs to pull in patient records and other confidential sources that general-purpose LLMs were never trained on. Health systems can use RAG to create highly personalized patient education materials, Syed notes. 

This highlights a key benefit of RAG, which is its ability to navigate unstructured data. Stroum points to evidence of coverage documents; an insurer operating in multiple states can easily have hundreds of these. With RAG, it’s possible to prompt a model to pull up the copay for a specific procedure under a specific plan in a specific county.

RAG is also a significant step forward from traditional search functionality, which struggles to recognize that differences between verb tenses (such as ran and run) shouldn’t necessarily impact search results.

“Today’s models can see what you’re asking, and they’re more forgiving,” Stroum says.
